 * Filter class for odometry velocity measurements. We use a Butterworth
 * filter, the odometry seems fairly stable and periodic except for extremely
 * regular disturbances in X. Not sure if these are caused by some sort of
 * bug in the matrices we use (fc_Transform, primarily) or reflect an actual
 * phenomenon.
